= How to run mutation tests

The Tamaya Extensions project supports
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing[mutation testing^] by
the integration of http://pitest.org/quickstart/maven/[PIT^]
to validate the quality and effectiveness of our tests.

== Running PIT

PIT is not part of the normal build process of Tamaya Extensions. Therefore it must
be executed manually by executing the following command:

[source:bash]
----
$ mvn -Pcoverage
or
$ mvn install org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
----
