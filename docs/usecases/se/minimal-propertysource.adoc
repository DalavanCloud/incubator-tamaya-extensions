=== Minimal Property Source SPI

Users expect that implementing an additional configuration property source is as easy as possible.
So there should be an SPI defined that allows any kind of data source to be used for providing configuration data.
The interface to be implemented is expected to be minimal to reduce the implementation burden. Default
methods should be used where possible, so only a few methods are expected to be required to implement.
