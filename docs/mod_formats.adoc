== Tamaya Formats (Extension Module)
=== Overview

Tamaya Formats is an extension module. Refer to the link::modules.html[extensions documentation] for further details.

Tamaya Formats provides an abstraction for configuration formats provding the following benefits:

* Parsing of resources in can be implemented separately from interpreting the different aspects/parts parsed. As an
  example a file format can define different sections. Depending on the company specific semantics of the sections
  a different set of +PropertySource+ instances must be created.
* Similarly the configuration abstraction can also be used as an interface for integrating Tamaya with alternate
  frameworks that provide logic for reading configuration files, such as Apache commons.configuration.
