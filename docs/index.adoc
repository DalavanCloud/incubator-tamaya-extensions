== Introduction
This documentation describes the Tamaya Configuration System. It provides an overview of the different building blocks and
links you to more detailed documentations.


=== Working Group
This work is being conducted as part of a community lead joint effort under the Apache Software Foundation. This
specification is the result of the collaborative work of the members of the Tamaya Users Group and the community at
large.


=== Goals
Configuration is a key feature in all kind of programming languages. Basically configuration is the parametrization of
well defined aspects of a software product without having to recompile/rebuild the code. Summarizing configuration
can affect basically every part of a system, which renders configuration to a real cross-cutting concern, usable in
many facets.


==== Targets
Tamaya targets to support all general configuration aspects in a system, e.g.

* application configuration
  ** plugins
  ** modules
  ** components
* Container configuration, e.g. of Java EE enabling portability and dynamic provisioning
* Configuration of CDI (interceptors, decorators and alternatives)
* Configuration of Bean Validation, JSF, web applications etc.
* Configuration of instances within Java SE, e.g. by passing instances to a method that injects configured values,
  and by providing accessors to evaluate current configuration values. This can be used explicitly or transparently
  by client code.

Since configuration is implemented and applied in various ways Tamaya will allow you to use

* multiple configuration locations, including remote locations
* multiple configuration formats, including custom formats
* multiple configuration loading mechanisms, including custom mechanisms. By default reading the classpath, files und
  URIs are supported by default.
* type conversion
* configuration filtering and property adapters
* configuration of collections


=== Required Java version
The full API is based on Java SE 8.0 language features, whereas a compatible implementation of API and Core
is similarly available for Java SE 7 as well.


== Overview
=== How is Tamaya organized

The Tamaya project consists of the following parts:

* The link:API.html[API] is a complete SE based configuration API, that provides the minimum of functionality needed.
  It is modelled in a extensible way and only requires a few kb. The main features supported by the link:API.html[] are:
  ** Reading configuration as String/String key/value pairs
  ** Reading configuration as type safe values, including type conversion.
  ** Extending configuration using operators and queries.
  ** An SPI providing abstractions for component lifecycle, property sources, property source providers, configuration
     context and property filters.
* The link:Core.html[Core] implements the link:API.html[API]. Basically with the core part (and the API) you are ready to go, but you may
  add additional extensions that provide more features that are very useful.
* Extensions are additional libraries that you can add to your project setup. Most important features are:
  ** Dynamic resolution of configured values.
  ** Pattern based resource location
  ** Configuration injection and configuration template support
  ** Support for additional configuration formats
  ** Collection Support
  ** Prepared configuration metamodels
  ** Integration with other frameworks as configuration consumer or producer.
* Finally the *documentation* module provides comprehensive documentation on all features provided.

== Further Information

* There is a small document discussing link:usecases.html[Use Cases] and
* a document discussing link:requirements.html[Requirements].

== Detailed Documentation

* link:API.html[Tamaya API Documentation] and link:../javadoc/api/index.html[API Javadoc]
* link:Core.html[Tamaya Core Documentation] and link:../javadoc/core/index.html[Core Javadoc]
* link:modules.html[Tamaya Modules Documentation] and link:../javadoc/modules/index.html[Extensions Javadoc]


== Examples
