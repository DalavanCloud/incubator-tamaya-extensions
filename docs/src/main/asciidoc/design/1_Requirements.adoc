== Requirements
=== Core Configuration Requirements
Based on the scope and use cases described above the following core requirements can be identified:

* Configuration is modelled as String based key/value pairs.
* Configuration can be combined using the GoF composite pattern. Hereby different composition policies can be applied, such as
  ** override: subsequent entries override existing ones.
  ** substraction: keys present in the second configuration will be removed.
  ** union-resolve: key/values were added, in case of conflicts a +ConfigException+ must be thrown.
  ** union-ignore: similar to union, whereas duplicates are ignored (leaving the initial value loaded).
  ** intersection:
