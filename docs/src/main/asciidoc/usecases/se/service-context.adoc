=== Adaptable Service Context

Tamaya should support an adaptable +ServiceContext+ to resolve any kind of implememntation services, both API services as core
framework services. The +ServiceContext+ should be dynamically replecable by configuring an alternate instance of
using the Java *ServiceContet+.
This decouples component usage from its load and management part and als greatly simplifies integration with
new/alternate runtime environments.
The service context is exptected to provide

* single singleton instances: these service can be cached.
* access to multiple instances which implement some commons SPI interface.
* as useful priorization of components is done by the model itself.
