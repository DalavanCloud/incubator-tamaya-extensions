=== Type Safe Properties

Users just want to access properties not only as Strings, but let Tamaya do the conversion to the required
or the configred target type. By defauklt all java.lang wrapper and primitive types should be supported, but also
other common types like date/time types, math numeric types and more.

It must be possible that users can register their own custom types.

Finally users also want to be able to dynamically provide or override type adaption (conversion), when reading a value,
for a certain key/value pair.
