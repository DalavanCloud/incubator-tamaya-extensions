=== Context Dependent Configuration

In multi tenancy setups or complex systems a hierarchical/graph model of contexts for configurations is required, or different runtime contexts are executed in parallel
within the same VN. What sounds normal for EE also may be the case for pure SE environments:

* Users want to be able to model different layers of runtime context
* Users want to identiofy the current layer, so configuration used may be adapted.
