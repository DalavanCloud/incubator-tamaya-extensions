=== Configuration Templates

Users want to be able to let Tamaya implement an interface template based on configuration.
This use case is pretty similar to the injection use case. Basically the values are not injected,
but cached within the template proxy returned, e.g. as +DynamicValue+.
Similarly it could even be possible to define callback methods (default methods)
or register listeners to DynamicValue instances returned.

Templates hereby can easily be managed, but provide a excellent mechanism to provide type-safe configuration
to clients in a very transparent way. Details can be controlled by using the same annotations as for
normal configuration injection.
