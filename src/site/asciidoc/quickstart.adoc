= Apache Tamaya Quickstart




// @todo By default you can provide multiple javaconfig.properties files, e.g. as part of multiple jars loaded into your system.
//The system internally creates one PropertySource for each file found on the classpath. All PropertySources created
//are ordered by their ordinal value (an int). These ordinal values can be either hardcoded, or be dynamically
//configurable as key within each file. The ladder can be done by defining a special Tamaya ordinal value as follows:
//
//    #override ordinal
//    tamaya.ordinal=123
//
//This assigns an ordinal of 123 to each entry in that configuration resource. Tamaya Core defines the following default
//ordinals (used, if no custom ordinal is defined):
//
//* System Properties -> 400
//* javaconfiguration.properties -> 100
//
//If you want to add additional file locations or formats or other functionality you miss, have a look at the numerous
//Tamaya extension modules (see below). Or just implement a PropertySource (or PropertySourceProvider) on your own and register
//it using the Java ServiceLoader.


//# Adding additional features


The fastest way to start with Tamaya is just using the _Core_ implementation,
implementing the **API** in small, minimalistic way. For that add the following
Maven dependency to your project:


[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{tamaya_mvn_group_id}</groupId>
    <artifactId>tamaya-core</artifactId>
    <version>{tamaya_version_current}</version>
</dependency>
----

Given that you can add your configuration properties to the following locations in your classpath:

[source]
----
META-INF/javaconfiguration.properties
----

Additionally also system properties are taken into account, hereby overriding the default properties. Overall
Tamaya by default defines the following configuration model per default (most significant first):

    . System Properties
    . META-INF/javaconfiguration.properties

There many modules that extend the capabilities of Tamaya.
These modules doe not depend on core, so alternative
implementations of the Tamaya API should work similarly.
Basically all modules can be simply added by adding their
Maven settings.
