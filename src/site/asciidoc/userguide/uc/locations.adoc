=== Configuration Locations

Users want to be able to

* read configuration from different locations.
* By default classpath and file resources are
  supported. But similarly remote access using a JSON ReST call should be possible.
* Tamaya should define a JSON and XML format for configuration.
* Configuration locations should be scannable using ant-styled resource patterns, if possible.
* Scanning and reading logic can be modularized by using a +ConfigReader+ interface.
