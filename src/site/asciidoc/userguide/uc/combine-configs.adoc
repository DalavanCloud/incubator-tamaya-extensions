=== Combine Configurations

Users want to be able to combine different configurations to a new configuration instance.
Hereby the resulting configuration can be

* a union of both, ignoring duplicates (and optionally log them)
* a union of both, duplicates are ignored
* a union of both, conflicts are thrown as ConfigException
* an intersection of both, containing only keys present and equal in both configurations
* an arbitrary mapping or filter, modelled by an +CombinationPolicy+, which basically can be modelled
  as +BiFunction<String, String, String>+, hereby
  ** a result of +null+ will remove the key
  ** any other result will use the value returned as final value of the combination.
