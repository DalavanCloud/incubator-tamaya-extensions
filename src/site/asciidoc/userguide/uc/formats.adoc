=== Configuration Formats

Users want to be able to use the format they prefer.

* properties, xml-properties and ini-format should be supported by default
* Other/custom formats should be easily addable by registering or providing the format on configuration evaluation (read).
* When possible Tamaya should figure out which format to be used and how the InputStream should be correctly
  interpreted.
